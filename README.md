GoodBackup. Not a bad way to schedule backups for your files and MySQL databases.

GoodBackup is a solution for performing nightly backups of your application state. Just create an XML configuration file (follow sampleconfig.xml for guidance), validate it with validate.py, and install it with install.py.
